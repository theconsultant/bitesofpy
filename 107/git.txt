## Code submission instructions:

git clone https://github.com/theconsultant/bitesofpy

# move the exercise zipfile into the bitesofpy directory
# unzip it and rename it to 107

cd bitesofpy/107/

# code your solution, make sure pytest is happy :)

pytest -v

# if so push your code to Github:

git add .
git commit -m "submission Bite 107 @ codechalleng.es"
git push

# in order to submit your code head over to https://codechalleng.es/bites/107
# and hit "Save and Run Tests" using the "Pull your code from the GH repo"
# checkbox (make sure we asserted the path of your code file!)

# Keep calm and code in Python!

# CRLF errors?
#from the bitesofpy folder do

git config core.autocrlf true
git config core.safecrlf false

#that will tell git to deal with line feeds correctly.
